**NOTE: This project is no longer maintained, because I don't work with Salesforce anymore.**

Ever needed to daily download a Salesforce report and curse your life because
it gets so tedious to do so manually in the browser or something?

Well, me too. To turn this process less painful, I created this package. By
using it, you will hopefully be able to download most Salesforce reports as a
**DataFrame** or an Excel **spreadsheet**.

Check out our documentation at [readthedocs](http://reportforce.rtfd.io/).

# Main Features

-   Supports downloading tabular, matrix and summary reports.
-   Workaround the 2000 row limit if you provide a column with unique values.
-   Download reports as Excel files.

# Example usage

```python
from reportforce import Reportforce

Reportforce("user", "pass", "token").get_report("00O1a000001YtFG")
```
